# calculator
For this final foundations project I will be using a combination of skills developed thus far to create an on-screen calculator using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

This calculator will contain functions for all the basic math operators and will display the numbers as they are clicked. Once the = key is clicked it will return the result of the calculation. Unlike a normal calculator, the numbers and operators will be evaluated in the order input rather than by normal order of operations.
